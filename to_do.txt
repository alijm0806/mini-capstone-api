3) Create a carted_products controller.
4) Make a carted_products create action.
* Assume everything is coming from params. Test it in requests.http.
* Change the user_id to come from current_user.id instead of params. Test it in requests.http
* Change the order_id to be nil instead of params. Test it in requests.http
* Change the status to always be “carted” instead of params. Test it in requests.http



5) Make a carted_products index action.
* Assume it’s showing all carted_products. Test it in requests.http.
* Change it to only show the current user’s carted products with a status of “carted”. Test it in requests.http.

###########
Fix the orders create action.
* Find all the current user’s carted products with a status of “carted”
* Create a new order with user_id, subtotal, tax, and total (this will require a loop to calculate)
* Modify the carted products to change the status to “purchased” and the order_id to the new order’s id
